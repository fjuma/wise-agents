# How to start a Redis database

There is a script named run_redis.sh in the same directory of this document.
The script starts a redis database.

For more information about redis use in wise-agents please check our documentation at [https://wise-agents.github.io/wise_agents_architecture/#distributed-architecture](https://wise-agents.github.io/wise_agents_architecture/#distributed-architecture)

If a .env file is present, it will read the environment variables from there.
The .env file should be in the same directory as the script.

Rename the .env.example file to .env and set the environment variables.
